  abstract = {Summary Bayesian experimental design is a fast growing area of
              research with many real-world applications. As computational power
              has increased over the years, so has the development of
              simulation-based design methods, which involve a number of
              algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, sequential Monte
              Carlo and approximate Bayes methods, facilitating more complex
              design problems to be solved. The Bayesian framework provides a
              unified approach for incorporating prior information and/or
              uncertainties regarding the statistical model with a utility
              function which describes the experimental aims. In this paper, we
              provide a general overview on the concepts involved in Bayesian
              experimental design, and focus on describing some of the more
              commonly used Bayesian utility functions and methods for their
              estimation, as well as a number of algorithms that are used to
              search over the design space to find the Bayesian optimal design.
              We also discuss other computational strategies for further research
              in Bayesian optimal design.},

  abstract = {This leading textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the
              fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at
              advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as
              researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern
              recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. This is the
              first machine learning textbook to include a comprehensive coverage
              of recent developments such as probabilistic graphical models and
              deterministic inference methods, and to emphasize a modern Bayesian
              perspective. It is suitable for courses on machine learning,
              statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision,
              data mining, and bioinformatics. This hard cover book has 738 pages
              in full colour, and there are 431 graded exercises. Solutions for
              these exercises and extensive support for course instructors are
              provided on Christopher Bishop's page. Now available to download in
              full as a PDF.},
